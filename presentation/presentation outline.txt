Outline for Glutimate Puffing presentation 2/17/23
I will present on the analysis pipeline

Note: Use trial(s) from kirsten Jan 19 data to walk through the pipeline
	**When Giving examples, use only 1 ROI and 1 frame to keep things simple
		Crop out 1 row of rawF and DF/F and compare it to florescence plot from fiji
	
Outline:

How do we quantify a video of activity?

Steps:

Start with video
draw rois
Calculate raw florescence
	for each frame and roi:
		mask frame with roi
		"convert" frame to grid of numbers
		sum up the values as raw florescence for that roi for that frame
Calculate DF/F
	for each roi:
		get the mean of the first 10 seconds of raw florescence (before puffing begins aka baseline activity)
		divide raw florescence by baseline to get DF/F for that roi
Plot values
	Use a color map to convert from florescence values to colors
